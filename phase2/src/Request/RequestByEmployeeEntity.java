    // Employees must be able to post on the Request forum, addressing messages to specific organizers if they wish to,
    // as well make room-specific requests/recommendations. Attendees cannot address themselves to a specific organizer
    // on this forum, nor mention rooms that have not been booked yet for conferences. Employees can do the latter.
